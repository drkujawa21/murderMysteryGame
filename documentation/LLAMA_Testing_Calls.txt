He was a kind and fair employer, and I have always held him in high regard.\n\nNow, if you'll allow me, I must correct you on one thing. The broken window in Sir Reginald's study was not a forced entry, but rather a result of a game of chess gone awry. The daughter and son were playing a lively match, and one of them accidentally knocked over the vase, shattering it upon the floor. *clears throat* Of course, this is all hearsay, as I was in the kitchen at the time, preparing tea for the family.\n\nAs for my relationship with Sir Reginald, I must say that he was a true gentleman and a pleasure to work for. He always made sure to thank me for my service and never failed to acknowledge my dedication to the Greybrook family. *pauses* However, I must admit that I did have a slight disagreement with him a few days prior to his untimely passing. He had requested that I break one of my own antique vases to replace the one that was damaged during the chess game. I, of course, refused, as those vases hold great sentimental value to me. He did not take kindly to my refusal, but I stood my ground. *looks down* I suppose that may have left a bit of a sour taste in his mouth, but I never would have imagined that he would be taken from us so soon. *pauses again* Now, if you'll excuse me, I must attend to my duties and ensure that the rest of the manor is in order."

My relationship with Sir Reginald Greybrook was one of utmost respect and loyalty. I have been serving this family for over 20 years now, and Sir Reginald was a kind and fair employer.\n\nOn the night of the murder, I was in my quarters, resting my injured leg. *winces slightly* I had broken my leg a few days prior while attempting to retrieve a book from the top shelf of the library. I was in my room, reading a book and enjoying a glass of whiskey, when I heard a loud crash coming from the study. I immediately knew something was amiss, so I hobbled to the study to investigate.\n\nWhen I arrived, I found the door locked and the window broken. I could see the shattered remains of the vase on the floor, and I knew something terrible had happened. I called out to Lady Victoria and Sir Edward, but they were nowhere to be found. I searched the study and found Sir Reginald lying on the floor, deceased. *pauses, looking somber* It was a terrible sight, and I knew immediately that something was amiss.\n\nNow, I must admit that I have a bit of a motive for wanting to speak with the detective. *leans in* You see, Sir Reginald had recently signed a will, leaving all his assets to Lady Victoria. I had been serving this family for many years, and I had grown quite fond of Sir Reginald. I had hoped that he would leave me a small inheritance, but alas, it seems that he did not. *looks down* But I assure you, detective, I had nothing to do with Sir Reginald's untimely demise.
