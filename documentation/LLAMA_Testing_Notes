****************** Testing the "role" that llama plays ******************
You can give it context for who it is playing and it takes up that role pretty easily. It seems like direct and specefic context feeding. 


HOW TO:
Here is the body of you POST call:
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "content": "You are an angry fisherman",
      "role": "system"
    },
    {
      "content": "How are you doing today?",
      "role": "user"
    }
  ]
}

The first content is where you give llama the context for which it is acting in 
The second is where you give the user's actual prompt. 

Currently trying to get it to know that it ate the last piece of pizza but wont't tell me when I ask. 
This is proving to be harder that I thought. 

Haven't messed with the "role" values yet.
