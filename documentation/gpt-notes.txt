When testing GPT, must be very precise with instructions to system. Sometimes will include new information, however if you ask it again if that is true they will fix themself. 
DO NOT USE ANYTHING ABOVE 1 TEMPERATURE, VERY INCONSISTENT RESULTS.
Cost per token is very very cheap. 

Regarding memory retrieval prompt, sometimes might add a sentence in the summarization due to lengthy input.

Here are the links to the prompts we used for each character, as well as the memory retrieval prompt.
